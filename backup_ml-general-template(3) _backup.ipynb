    "# XGBoost/Pipeline/GridSearchCV/EarlyStopping Machine Learning Model - GENERAL TEMPLATE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author: Daniel Diaz Moncada**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date: 2022-09-29**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version: 0.1.1**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is a general Machine Learning template I built to use mainly for XGBoost models benefiting from the combination of doing Hyperparameter-Tuning with a GridSearchCV and using Early Stopping while pre-processing data through a Pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* During the Hyperparameter-Tuning phase, data is actually pre-processed externally, and then fed to the model, meaning that the preprocessor object and the predicting model are not bundled together in the same Pipeline, and the reason for this limitation is that since Early Stopping is being used, it requires an evaluation dataset which is simply not preprocessed directly as the training dataset when given to a Pipeline that bundles a preprocessor object and a predicting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The evaluation dataset is required in order to verify whether the loss function is increasing or decreasing in order to stop early or continue training for that round when testing any given combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* After determining the optimal set of hyperparameters, the original training dataset and validation dataset are joined as a complete training dataset, and a Final Model is generated and trained with the best combination of hyperparameters found. This Final Model does not require EarlyStopping for training since only one combination of parameters will be run. In this Final Model, we do not require Early Stopping or any further evaluation set which previously generated the inconvenience of requiring preprocessing data outside the Pipeline, therefore we can now build our final model with the great convenience of bundling together a preprocessor object and a predicting model within a Pipeline and finally fed to a GridSearchCV object that performs cross-validation, however this time it won't require hyperparameter tuning, but simply use a single combination of the best hyperparameters found during the Hyperparameter-Tuning phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This Final Model after performing its final training is dumped into a .pkl file and then the .pkl file is loaded and makes predictions on the new unseen data to which it is fed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This template is a very convenient and adaptable way to get started making powerful ML models with a great architecture, with all the benefits of an efficient and adaptable Pre-Processing Pipeline, an XGBoost model, Early Stopping for efficient enough Hyperparameter-Tuning, cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is much more you can add to improve the model, and adjust it to your needs, but it is definitely a great template to start with."
