NEXT STEPS (old_long branch):
Ensure to adapt the script to a Multi-Models dictionary with its parameters, and that it can be iterated in a loop for training, tuning and evaluating multiple models, while also saving the best parameters found for each model, the test predictions and the performance evaluation.

This models dictionary should have models for classification and also for regression for being able to use it as a skeleton template for quickly applying at minimum effort a fully integrated poweful ML project, beginning from a Feature Engineering template using a Pipeline for Preprocessing Numerical and Categorical(Nominal and Ordinal) features, and then entering into the phase of Modeling Selection and Training (where this models dictionary and set of parameters is used for Hyperparameter Tuning while training, tuning and retraining different models with optimized parameters) and finally Model Performance Evaluation and Save the Best model in a .pkl file with joblib.

The old long branch would go up to here, while then the new_short branch will continue the work done here, but simply reduce the comments, as they are often unnecessary, overwhelming and even self-explanatory for an experienced Data Scientist, so scope of the comments should be clear for whom it is, is it for myself to keep valuable notes for reference or should it be very short for being able to show the project faster to people whose interest is to assess my level of skills. That is the main difference in scope between the old_long branch and the new_short branch, one is for personal reference and the other is for presenting a prettier, more compact and elegant version, despite losing some details for the sake of readability and cleanliness.

Either way, in the end, the new_short branch will be easier to maintain and also will aloow me to transfer my template into .py file(s) so that I can use a more modular approach, where each clear phase within the Data Science cycle is considered a module and each one has a very clearly defined input and output.

Consult the ideas in ChatGPT for the models dictionary looping, as well as the Data Science cycle phases/modules with well defined comprhension boundaries and clearly defined inputs/outputs.
